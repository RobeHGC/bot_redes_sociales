## Tasks

- [ ] Design scheduling database schema
- [ ] Implement scheduled job system with Celery
- [ ] Create scheduling API endpoints
- [ ] Add timezone support
- [ ] Implement recurring post patterns
- [ ] Create conflict detection system
- [ ] Add scheduling queue management
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed posts
- [ ] Create scheduling dashboard view
- [ ] Add bulk scheduling capabilities

## Technical Details

### Scheduling Features
- One-time posts
- Recurring posts (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Optimal time suggestions

    # Post to platforms
    # Update status
    # Handle failures
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can schedule posts for future times
- [ ] Supports multiple timezone selections
