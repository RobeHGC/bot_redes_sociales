## Description

Set up the complete deployment infrastructure and DevOps pipeline for the Nadia bot, including containerization, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and production deployment strategies.

## Parent Issue

- #1 - MVP - Single User Medical Social Media Bot

## Tasks

- [ ] Create Docker configurations for all services
- [ ] Set up docker-compose for local development
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Set up cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP)
- [ ] Implement infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Set up logging aggregation
- [ ] Implement backup strategies
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates and domain

## Technical Details

### Container Structure
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.api
FROM python:3.9-slim
# API service configuration

# Dockerfile.worker
FROM python:3.9-slim
# Background worker configuration

# Dockerfile.frontend
FROM node:18-alpine
# Frontend build configuration
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
- Lint code
- Run tests
- Build containers
- Push to registry
- Deploy to staging
- Run E2E tests
- Deploy to production
```

### Infrastructure Components
- **Compute**: ECS/GKE for containers
- **Database**: RDS/Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: ElastiCache/Memorystore for Redis
- **Storage**: S3/Cloud Storage for media
- **CDN**: CloudFront/Cloud CDN
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch/Stackdriver
- **Secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager/Secret Manager

### Monitoring Stack
- Application metrics (Prometheus)
- Log aggregation (ELK/CloudWatch)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)
- Performance monitoring (New Relic/DataDog)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Application runs in Docker containers
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys automatically
- [ ] Infrastructure is version controlled
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are configured
- [ ] Logs are centralized and searchable
- [ ] Backups run automatically
- [ ] SSL certificates are configured
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments work
- [ ] Rollback procedures are documented
