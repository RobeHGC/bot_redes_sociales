# Issue: Multi-Tenant Architecture

## Description

Transform the single-user MVP into a scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform that can support multiple medical professionals and organizations. This requires significant architectural changes to ensure data isolation, scalability, and performance.

## Future Enhancement

This issue represents post-MVP development for scaling the platform.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design multi-tenant database architecture
- [ ] Implement tenant isolation strategies
- [ ] Create organization/team structures
- [ ] Add tenant-aware authentication
- [ ] Implement per-tenant configuration
- [ ] Create tenant provisioning system
- [ ] Add resource usage tracking
- [ ] Implement tenant-specific customization
- [ ] Create admin portal for tenant management
- [ ] Add data migration tools for existing users

## Technical Details

### Multi-Tenancy Approaches

#### Database Design Options
1. **Shared Database, Shared Schema** (Row-level security)
   - Add tenant_id to all tables
   - Implement RLS policies
   - Efficient resource usage

2. **Shared Database, Separate Schema**
   - Schema per tenant
   - Better isolation
   - More complex migrations

3. **Database per Tenant**
   - Complete isolation
   - Higher costs
   - Easier compliance

### Implementation Details
```python
class TenantAwareModel(BaseModel):
    tenant_id = Column(UUID, nullable=False)
    
    @declared_attr
    def __table_args__(cls):
        return (Index(f'ix_{cls.__tablename__}_tenant_id', 'tenant_id'),)

class TenantMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app
    
    async def __call__(self, scope, receive, send):
        # Extract and validate tenant context
        pass
```

### Features
- Tenant onboarding workflow
- Subdomain support (clinic1.nadia.health)
- Tenant-specific branding
- Usage quotas and limits
- Tenant data export
- Cross-tenant analytics (admin only)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multiple tenants can use the system simultaneously
- [ ] Data is completely isolated between tenants
- [ ] Tenant onboarding is automated
- [ ] Performance doesn't degrade with tenant count
- [ ] Admin can manage all tenants
- [ ] Tenants can customize their instance
- [ ] Resource usage is tracked per tenant
- [ ] Migration from single to multi-tenant works

## Dependencies

- MVP completion (#1)

## Estimated Effort

4-6 weeks
