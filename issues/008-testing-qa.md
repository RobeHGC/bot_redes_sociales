# Issue: Testing and Quality Assurance

## Description

Establish comprehensive testing strategies and implement test suites to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of the Nadia bot system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance testing.

## Parent Issue

- #1 - MVP - Single User Medical Social Media Bot

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up testing framework and infrastructure
- [ ] Write unit tests for core modules
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Add performance and load testing
- [ ] Create test data generators
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with tests
- [ ] Add security testing suite
- [ ] Create test documentation
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

## Technical Details

### Testing Stack
- **Unit Testing**: pytest
- **API Testing**: pytest + httpx
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright or Selenium
- **Load Testing**: Locust
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Bandit
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
- Business logic validation
- Service layer methods
- Utility functions
- Model validations
- Content generation prompts

#### Integration Tests
- API endpoint functionality
- Database operations
- External API interactions
- Queue processing
- Authentication flows

#### E2E Tests
- User registration and login

- Post scheduling flow
- Platform connection setup
- Analytics viewing

#### Performance Tests
- API response times
- Database query optimization
- Concurrent user handling
- Background job processing
- Memory usage patterns

### Test Data
```python
# factories.py
class UserFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_medical_professional():
        # Generate test medical professional
        pass

class ContentFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_medical_post():
        # Generate test medical content
        pass
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] All API endpoints have integration tests
- [ ] Critical user flows have E2E tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are identified
- [ ] CI/CD runs all tests on commits
- [ ] Test reports are generated automatically
- [ ] Flaky tests are identified and fixed
- [ ] Test documentation is complete
